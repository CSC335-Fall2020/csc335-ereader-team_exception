When WWII ended in 1945, two countries emerged from the rubble and devastation, the US and the USSR. The US suffered the least from WWII, both socially and economically. The US exerted its economic superiority with the Marshall Plan, giving money to ruined European countries to support their rehabilitation, and to extend the US’s influence into Europe with the US’s capabilities in infrastructure. Whereas the USSR, influenced by socialism as introduced by Marx, saw themselves as in a conflict with bourgeois capitalism and democracy. What caused the Soviet Union to change from communist reconstruction and stabilization under Lenin to socialist and violent control and influence under Stalin? The main reason for the Cold War tensions people are familiar with today is dramatic changes and developments in Soviet foreign policy, and the USSR’s motive for extending its power changed from converting Russia into socialist and then communist under Lenin to converting the rest of the world into communist under Stalin. The Soviet Union saw the US’s rebuilding in Europe as an attempt to take over Europe because of its superior economy and power and eventually destroy the Soviet system. Immediately after WWII, the Soviet Union expanded its sphere of influence, taking over portions of Eastern Europe where the Red Army had beaten the Nazis. In response to this, the US initiated containment, a policy that encouraged non-Communist/Socialist countries to stand up to the Soviets and prevent their spread of influence. In 1922, most governments internationally regarded the Soviet régime as a pariah because of its advocacy of communism, and thus most states did not give it diplomatic recognition. Less than a quarter century later the Soviet Union not only had official relations with the majority of the nation-states of the world, but had progressed to the role of a superpower. Marxist–Leninist ideology reinforced other characteristics of Soviet political culture that created an attitude of competition and conflict with other states. Before WWII, Lenin and the Bolsheviks shifted their ideological focus from the world revolution and building socialism around the globe to building socialism inside the Soviet Union, while keeping some of the rhetoric and operations of the Comintern continuing. After WWII, however, when the Soviet Union was economically devastated but politically empowering, Stalin took over after Lenin died in 1924. Stalin realized that the USSR was already stable as a communist power. Soviet foreign policy underwent a series of changes during the first decade of Stalin’s rule. Soon after assuming control of the party, Stalin oversaw a radicalization of Soviet foreign policy that complemented his strenuous domestic policies. To heighten the urgency of his demands for modernization, Stalin portrayed the Western powers, particularly France, as warmongers eager to attack the Soviet Union. Russia has experienced quite a few dramatic changes to its society, government, and economy. Another major change in Russia’s history was its abolishment of serfdom. Alexander II was one of Russia’s more liberal leaders. He recognized that Russia’s feudal system – long since abandoned by Western European powers – was a liability. Russia’s weakness had been demonstrated by its defeat in the Crimean War, in which its armies of conscripted serfs had been regularly outmatched by the volunteer armies of France and Great Britain. The war effort had also been hampered because Russia’s largely agricultural society was unable to compete with the industrialised Empires of Western Europe. Alexander published his Emancipation Manifesto in March 1861. The Manifesto was quickly turned into law, and all privately owned serfs were given the right to become free citizens, free to marry, own land and their own businesses. Those tied to the land were entitled to buy the land they had previously leased, but not at a very good rate.
Traditional conservatism grasped European politics for centuries. At the Congress of Vienna in 1815, after the fall of Napoleon, the displaced rulers of Europe reaffirmed legitimacy and the balance of power. Great effort was exerted to restore the monarchies overthrown by Napoleon. But, as nationalism rose with the Revolutions of 1830 and 1848, a new kind of conservatism arose amongst the ideals of rulers of European countries. Otto von Bismarck, German chancellor in the late 19th century, practiced a new kind of conservatism with surprising flexibility and unseen-before concern for the working class. A prominent disregard for traditional state management from Bismarck was his law that abolished civil restrictions based on a person’s religion (Document 1). Bismarck likely wanted to strengthen his position in government by earning the vote of religious minorities. The laws passed by Bismarck’s government were issued shortly after Germany was unified after the Franco-Prussian War. This indicates that Bismarck saw toleration as a tool for his political success, starkly unlike traditional absolute monarchs. Alongside his policy of toleration, Bismarck also had an unusual way of dealing with his opponents. This is seen in Liebknecht’s speech, who was a German socialist. In his speech, Liebknecht urges his audience to avoid engaging directly with the Reichstag, because repression from the government means the SPD won’t be able to influence legislation (Document 2). Even those who opposed Bismarck admitted to his prowess. Eugen Richter, a liberal politician who wasn’t a big fan of Bismarck, despite lauding Bismarck’s dismissal, implicitly praising Bismarck’s efforts to “unify the Fatherland” (Document 7). However, Bismarck’s campaign wasn’t without obstacles. A prominent stumbling block for Bismarck was the political competition between conservatives, liberals, and ultramontanes. The influence of each political group varied, sometimes conservatives were winning, sometimes liberals would be “on top” (Document 4). Bismarck’s new conservatism wasn’t well suited enough to tackle each. Hermann Wagener, a conservative politician under Bismarck, warned Bismarck against battling the ultramontane and the liberals and the same time. Wagener describes a theoretical battle against both sides as “extremely dangerous” and “hopeless” (Document 3). Despite opposition in his unique campaign, Bismarck readily applied new legislation and ideas to his crusade. Contrary to traditional conservatism, Bismarck introduced and passed an accident insurance bill, further expressing his concern for the working and middle classes (Document 6). Bismarck dismissed traditional principles to preserve the power of both himself and his state. Bismarck’s policies are rather similar to those of Camillo de Cavour, Prime Minister of Piedmont-Sardinia in 1861. Both Bismarck and Cavour employed diplomacy and moderation over warfare and oppression. However, Cavour had more leniency with which to exercise toleration. Bismarck came to power in an era where many major European countries were trying to stop Prussia from becoming a European power.
The Cold War became a dominant influence on many aspects of American society for much of the second half of the 20th century. It escalated due to antagonist values between the United States, representing capitalism and democracy, and the Soviet Union, representing communism and authoritarianism. Being the two dominant world powers after WWII, contention between the Americans and Soviets became a global conflict. The Cold War differed from most wars in that it was as much of a propaganda war as a war with military engagements. The Korean and Vietnam Wars are important examples of military intervention by the Americans in the name of stopping communist expansionism. However, these wars did not have the decades long impact on American domestic and foreign policy that the cultural, political, and economic battles of the Cold War had. The post-Cold War era saw optimism, and the balance of power shifted solely to the United States. With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, containment no longer made sense, so in the past ten years, the United States has been redefining its foreign policy. What are its responsibilities, if any, to the rest of the world, now that it has no incentive of luring them to the American "side" in the Cold War? Do the United States still need allies? What action should be taken, if any, when a "hot spot" erupts, causing misery to the people who live in the nations involved? The answers are not easy. With the breakup of the Soviet Union into separate nations, and the re-emergence of the nation of Russia, the world of pro-U.S. and pro-Soviet alliances broke down. Different challenges presented themselves, such as climate change and the threat of nuclear terrorism. Regional powerbrokers in Iraq and Saddam Hussein challenged the peace with a surprise attack on the small nation of Kuwait in 1991. President George H.W. Bush organized a coalition of allied and Middle Eastern powers that successfully pushed back the invading forces, but stopped short of invading Iraq and capturing Hussein. As a result, the dictator was free to cause mischief for another twelve years. After the Gulf War, many scholars like Zbigniew Brzezinski claimed that the lack of a new strategic vision for U.S. foreign policy resulted in many missed opportunities for its foreign policy. The United States mostly scaled back its foreign policy budget as well as its cold war defense budget during the 1990s, which amounted to 6.5% of GDP while focusing on domestic economic prosperity under President Clinton, who succeeded in achieving a budget surplus for 1999 and 2000. The aftermath of the Cold War continues to influence world affairs. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the post–Cold War world was widely considered as unipolar, with the United States the sole remaining superpower. The Cold War marked the apex of peacetime military-industrial complexes, especially in the United States, and large-scale military funding of science. These complexes, though their origins may be found as early as the 19th century, have grown considerably during the Cold War. The military-industrial complexes have great impact on their countries and help shape their society, policy and foreign relations. A concept that defined the world power after the Cold-War was known as the new world order. The most widely discussed application of the phrase of recent times came at the end of the Cold War. Presidents Mikhail Gorbachev and George H.W. Bush used the term to try to define the nature of the post Cold War era, and the spirit of a great power cooperation they hoped might materialize. Historians will look back and say this was no ordinary time but a defining moment: an unprecedented period of global change, and a time when one chapter ended and another began. However, peace was superficial. A new war front emerged from the end of the Cold War, one that is still raging today, perhaps stronger than ever: the War on Terror, a term commonly applied to an international military campaign begun by the United States and United Kingdom with support from other countries after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The campaign’s official purpose was to eliminate al-Qaeda and other militant organizations. Alongside the rise of terrorist networks and other rogue organizations in Afghanistan and Iraq, the US grew extremely wary and tightened security, as seen in the unanimous approval of the Patriot Act. The War on Terror also affected other aspects of US federal policy such as immigration and border security. Before 9/11, immigration was relatively lenient and lax. Airport security checks weren’t really a thing until after the two planes were hijacked. Afterwards, security was tightened, debate rages over immigration even today, and yet terrorists still manage to invoke terror, both domestically and internationally.
The American Revolution was a political upheaval where the thirteen colonies in North America rejected the authority of the British monarchy, fought for their freedom, and founded the United States of America. This caused waves of tremor to shake the foundations of Europe that had existed since the end of the Middle Ages. The American Revolution had profound effects of European society. These effects were political, social, and economic. Politically, the American Revolution had one major consequence: it sparked the French Revolution. When the people in France saw how successfully the thirteen colonies had rebelled and overthrew the absolute rule controlling them, they were inspired to revolt against Louis XVI and the French absolute monarchy, which led to the French Revolution. Many of the Third Estate of France sought to use the American Revolution to justify rebelling against the absolute monarchy. Liberal revolutionaries during the French Revolution saw the Declaration of Independence as sort of a model, proving that the beliefs enlightened thinkers, such as Locke, Hobbes, and Rousseau, were not just ideals. They could happen, and they did happen in America. The American Revolution served another big purpose in the politics of the world at that time. American independence signified the creation of a new power in the world political/economic scene.  With its history of European ties, an independent America was sure to become a key political and economic player in European affairs. Economically, the American Revolution caused the major powers in Europe to be in debt. France was in debt from helping the colonies, Britain was in debt from fighting against the colonies. France’s enormous debt was another factor that led to the French Revolution. The government in France tried to resolve this financial crisis by levying land taxes and raising the prices of goods, such as bread. France was not the only one in debt. Britain spent a huge amount of money fighting in the Revolutionary War, increasing national debt hugely. Taxes had to be raised as a result. The overseas trade which Britain relied on for wealth was severely interrupted, with imports and exports experiencing large drops and the recession which followed caused prices to plummet. A government which can survive a failed war without pressure is rare, and in Britain the failure of the American Revolutionary War led to demands for constitutional reform. Also, many major countries in France relied on the Columbian Exchange for raw materials, bullion, food staples, and other forms of wealth. Now that the colonies won their independence, they will no longer provide those resources to their enemies in Europe. Britain will no longer be able to profit from overseas trading in the Americas. Socially, the American Revolution indirectly encouraged equality and liberty. Many slaves from Africa, brought over by Britain, were given emancipation by fighting alongside the colonies. The Declaration of Independence paved the way for the National Constituent Assembly writing the Declaration of the Rights of Man and Citizen. The American Revolution can be related to the Haitian Revolution from 1794 - 1801. The Haitian Revolution is considered one of the most successful slave rebellions in history. The Haitian Revolution is also related to the French Revolution in that the Haitian Revolution was inspired by the French. However, the Haitian slaves did not wait. The underrepresented majority of the population rebelled and won their freedom, similar to the Revolutionary War.
Effects of Napoleon on European Society: In 1804, Napoleon Bonaparte, one of the most famous military leaders of all time, rose to power and was anointed Emperor of France. Napoleon had a significant impact on Europe, ending the French Revolution, creating the Napoleonic code of civil law and waging conquest throughout Europe during the Napoleonic Wars. Even though Napoleon was eventually defeated by an alliance of all the other European major powers of the time, Napoleon’s ideals of freedom, social equality and the abolishing of European feudalism had a great political, economic, and social impacts on many European nations. The French Revolution was a tumultuous time in France. Political upheaval was constant, as the people of France attempted to overthrow a number of monarchs seizing power and then failing. Napoleon ended this when he became Emperor. He gave France a strong economy backed in silver and gold. He established religious freedom and low prices for basic foods to keep the citizens from starving. Not only did he improve life in France, but he established legal precedents for civil law, referred to as the Napoleonic codes, that are still recognized today. The Napoleonic Code is one of Napoleon’s most important contributions to French politics, even today. It reorganized the French legal structure and gave France a unified, progressive system. Napoleon also helped establish equality among men. He reinforced the French motto “liberty, fraternity, and equality”. Napoleon also planted seeds of nationalism and liberalism throughout Europe and spread new ways of revolution across the globe. Economically, Napoleon reversed France’s terrible economic state from disaster to prosperity. The terrible French economy was one of the key factors leading to the French Revolution. The working class was angry that the monarch did nothing to stop the high prices of staple foods and the low wages, and this anger led to revolt. When Napoleon came to power, he turned the economy around Fair taxes, increased trade, the development of French luxury industries, a new commercial code, an improved infrastructure, and a central bank to control monetary policy were keys to his success. Socially, Napoleon reformed religion, education, and freedom. The Catholic Church had had a major influence on French politics and society, but the French Revolution got rid of its power. Napoleon reached an agreement with the Pope Pius VII, allowing the Church a major role in French society while providing religious freedom for all others. This, while contradicting Napoleon’s views that the Ancien Regime was old-fashioned, helped strengthen his position as Emperor because with the Catholic Church on his side, nobody would think about overthrowing him. Also, religious freedom for all satisfied citizens after decades of religious restrictions from previous monarchies. To create a middle-class cadre (a small group of people specially trained for a particular purpose or profession) of leaders, Napoleon reorganized France’s education system. He restarted the primary schools, created a new secondary system of schools, and established many other schools for the general populace. He promoted education for girls and greatly improved teacher training. Literacy levels in France soared under Napoleon’s reforms. One last factor that Napoleon influenced was freedom for Jews. In various parts of Europe, Jews had been forced to wear arm bands, kept from certain professions, made to live in ghettos, and prevented from attending their synagogues. Napoleon put an end to all of those restrictions, made Jews full citizens of France, and even wrote a proclamation that established the idea of a Jewish homeland in Israel. Napoleon’s empire, accompanied by his legal and other reforms, helped provide the basis for what is today the European Union. He worked hard to create a unified Italy, Poland, and Germany. Napoleon was also responsible for sweeping away many of the old regimes and promoting the ideals of equality and European solidarity. Sure, the old regimes still had some life in them when Napoleon left the scene, but things were never really the same. For that reason, Napoleon is often considered the father of modern Europe.
After the Civil War, reconstruction began. The war brought the end to slavery but the battle for a stable life for Africans had just begun. African Americans still were not considered citizens and struggled for jobs that allowed them to work for themselves. Being former slaves, they had no money, meaning it became difficult to buy for themselves. Over the course of time these issues called for action and efforts began to be created to help African Americans and equal rights. The postwar period began with a series of fairly lenient Reconstruction plans put forth by presidents Lincoln and Johnson, who were both eager to see the former Confederacy returned to the Union with as much speed and as little vindictiveness as possible. When white Southern intransigence followed the nation's first Civil Rights Act, Congress passed the Ku Klux Klan Act, which gave federal authorities jurisdiction over both states and individuals who tried to deprive freedmen and women of their newfound rights. Never before had the federal government intervened so forcefully and directly on behalf of its citizens, let alone its most castigated and impoverished minority. With these positive efforts there were also negative efforts that tried to stop African Americans from having the full luxury of being a free citizen of the U.S. Efforts made for equal rights such as the Freedmen's Bureau as well as the 14th and 15th amendment were much more effective compared to the efforts against equal rights such as President Johnson's many vetoes against equality and the brutal battles with the Klu Klux Klan. When the war was over there were many left homeless,starving and injured. In March of 1865 Congress created the Freedmen's Bureau which acted as a flare agency. This agency helped the sick, homeless and starving men of the war, both black and white. They were successful in many things, one in particular was education. With the help of their leader, General Oliver O Howard, it was able to establish nearly 3000 schools for freed blacks, including several colleges. They taught an estimated 200,000 African-Americans how to read which would benefit them in their newly freed lives. Black scholar W.E.B. Du Bois, who was born in 1868—the year that the 14th Amendment was ratified—famously termed the Reconstruction period a "splendid failure," for it didn't fail for the reasons that whites thought or expected that it would. Rather than revealing any innate inferiority or incompetence, some 2,000 Black Americans governed reasonably well in nearly every level of government, from the Senate to the local sheriff and tax collector. But by discrediting the era in which Blacks were most active politically, historians, filmmakers, politicians, and writers from across the country effectively acquitted the white South of disenfranchising Blacks under the Redemption and Jim Crow periods. They permitted racial segregation and discrimination, and even sanctioned it, for over a century.
The Era of Good Feelings marked a period in the political history of the United States that reflected a sense of national purpose and a desire for unity among Americans in the aftermath of the War of 1812. However, more than a few historians argue that the “Era of Good Feelings” is a misnomer, with a plethora of reasons. The Era of Good Feelings was not very good at all considering tensions within the Democratic-Republicans, the Panic of 1819, and the issue of slavery. Although this period has often been called the Era of Good Feelings due to its one-party dominance, in fact, Democratic-Republicans were deeply divided internally and a new political system was about to be created from the old Republican-Federalist competition that had been known as the First Party System. Although Democratic-Republicans were now the only active national party, its leaders incorporated major economic policies that had been favored by Federalists since the time of Alexander Hamilton. President Monroe continued the policies begun by Madison at the end of his presidency to build an American System of national economic development. Even though the Federalists lost all their power after the Hartford Convention and the War of 1812, the Democratic-Republicans weren’t the most unified political party. Also during this time there was slight separation among the people. In the Era of Good Feelings cotton plantations were rising in the south. In order to accommodate for the extensive labor needed for this cash crop, slaves were depended upon in the south. Separation over the matter of slavery would exist in America from this time through the Civil War. In addition, the Missouri Compromise was reached due to the fact that Missouri wanted to become a slave state, but it was not favored since it would tip the political balance in the South’s favor. After heated debates, Henry Clay came up with the compromise which will admit Missouri as a slave state, Maine as a free state, and in the rest of the Louisiana Territory north of latitude 36 30, slavery was prohibited. This shows the sectionalism issues that occurred during the Era of Good Feelings. The reaching of the compromise showed how heavy the debate whether slavery should be allowed or banned in Missouri was. Lastly, the Panic of 1819 was a financial panic due to a fault of the Second Bank of the US. State banks were closed, money fell, and bankruptcies. This all affected mostly the West in which it left many in debt. Westerners began calling for land reform and expressing despise to the national bank and debtor’s prisons. This shows how the union was not always strongly stable when it experienced hard situations. The federal government was incapable of handling crises under Henry Clay’s American system, with the Democratic Republicans too divided to maintain order in the country. Some may argue that the Era of Good Feelings was a satisfactory period due to the status of America strengthening as a whole. The economy was strengthened by the Henry Clay’s American System, new inventions, and transportation improvements. However, the Era of Good Feelings ended too soon to be considered a positive recuperation. And the Era of Good Feelings was not helpful in contributing a lasting change to the United States. Sectionalism was growing, political tensions arose in the federal government and parties, and the Panic of 1819 force many to conclude that the Era of Good Feelings left America feeling not so good.
The revolutions of 1830 and 1848 were waves of political upheavals throughout Europe. The three most important revolutions to this essay are the French and Belgian revolutions of 1830 and the French revolution of 1848. The causes of those three revolutions vary to some degree; however, the main cause was widespread political discontent. The Romantic revolution in Belgium in 1830 broke out on 25 August 1830 with a minor insurrection among the capital’s bourgeoisie, who sang patriotic songs and captured some public buildings in the city, protesting against Dutch rule imposed in 1815. This early revolutionary group was swelled by a large number of urban workers. Heavy fighting took place between Dutch forces and Brussels revolutionaries, who were reinforced by small contingents from across the country. The Dutch were eventually forced to retreat. The first King of the Belgians, Leopold I, was crowned in July 1831. The main cause of the Belgian revolution was displeasure with Dutch rule. Belgian citizens were not pleased with the Dutch restricting their independence and autonomy, much like the American Revolution. Both the colonies and the people of Belgium rose up against their oppressors and won their freedom. The Belgians became an independent state with a liberal constitution to ensure that there would be no more arrangements of the kind. The two French Revolutions, in 1830 and 1848, were two major events that not only impacted France, but the rest of Europe as well. The French Revolution of 1830, also known as the July Revolution, was enacted after Louis XVIII died, and his brother, Charles X, rose to power. He published the July Ordinances, which dissolved the Chamber of Deputies and suspended freedom of the press. Many citizens of France opposed this. On Tuesday, July 27, 1830, fighting broke out in the streets of Paris between military officials and angered citizens. The rebels gained control and forced Charles X to abdicate to Great Britain. The leaders of the revolution started a second Republic, one of many shifts in the government structure in France. The causes of this revolution are similar to those of the Belgian revolution: displeasure with the government. The people of France wanted more voting rights and more influence on the royal court, especially the middle and lower classes. However, the July Ordinances did the exact opposite. Charles X wanted to limit the power of the people and suppress the say of the people. Due to this conflict, the French revolted. But even after the revolution, the middle class was still divided. Conservatives wanted to restore loyal monarchies they had lost from Napoleon, maintain a divided social hierarchy, restore the church, and suppress revolutionary ideas. Liberals advocated for natural rights, rulers elected by the people, and a Republican government. The French Revolution of 1848 was started for reasons very similar to the July Revolution. The citizens of France were once again angered by the way the country was being run, and were unhappy that only about 1% of the population was allowed to vote. Thus, fighting once again broke out between French officials and displeased citizens, and the citizens came out on top. King Louis Philippe fled to England and a republic was then set up in France. Another important revolution at this time was the November Uprising, or Poland’s revolt for independence against Russia. Otto von Bismarck, arguably the most important figure toward unifying Germany, supported Russia to put down the uprising, despite most of the other major powers either supporting Poland or turning a blind eye. Russia managed to crush to rebellion and maintain Poland under its control. These revolutions paved the way for nationalism, which was the ideology that people with a common heritage should be united together by that nationality, not by religion or other influences. This became an especially debated topic in the German states and Austria, since those two countries were comprised of multiple city-states with people speaking different languages and of different ethnicities.
The First Great Awakening was the nation's first major religious revival, occurring in the middle of the 18th century, and it injected new vigor into Christian faith. It was a wave of religious enthusiasm among Protestants that swept the colonies in the 1730s and 1740s, leaving a permanent impact on American religion. Jonathan Edwards was a key leader and a powerful intellectual in colonial America. George Whitefield came over from England and made many converts. On the surface, the Great Awakening weakened the status of the “Old Church” and encouraged believers to exercise their own judgment. The Awakening was also similar to the Enlightenment in that they both urged the spirit and logic of reason, emphasized the power and right of individual decision making. Historians have extended this argument to argue that the philosophy of self-government that drove the American Revolution was influenced or perhaps stemmed from the ideals of the Great Awakening and the Enlightenment. When we look at other events around the Great Awakening and the Revolution, this statement is quite accurate and very defensible. One aspect of the Revolution was the creation of the Declaration of Independence, who were significantly influenced by the philosophes of the Enlightenment. The Enlightenment was the root of many of the ideas of the American Revolution. It was a movement that focused mostly on freedom of speech, equality, freedom of press, and religious tolerance. Europeans of the 17th century no longer lived in the “darkness” of the Middle Ages. The Protestant Reformation encouraged free thinkers to question the practices of the Catholic Church, and the printing press spread the new ideas relatively quickly and easily. The time was ripe for the philosophes, scholars who promoted democracy and justice through discussions of individual liberty and equality. Philosophes like Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Rousseau were more optimistic about democracy. The single most important influence that shaped the founding of the United States comes from John Locke, who was optimistic about people’s ability to use reason to avoid tyranny. According to Locke, a ruler gains authority through the consent of the governed. The duty of that government is to protect the natural rights of the people, which Locke believed to include life, liberty, and property. If the government should fail to protect these rights, its citizens would have the right to overthrow that government. This idea deeply influenced Thomas Jefferson as he drafted the Declaration of Independence, who paraphrased Locke’s ideas about natural rights to “life, liberty, and pursuit of happiness.” Ironically, the English government was broken up into three branches identical to the ones we have today, which shows that the American leaders got the design of the American government from the people we got our independence from. The Revolution also was heavily influenced by the Great Awakening. The (1st) Great Awakening was a Protestant revival that left a permanent impact on American Protestantism. The First Great Awakening led to changes in Americans' understanding of God, themselves, the world around them, and religion. In the Middle and Southern colonies, the message of spiritual equality appealed to many slaves and, as African religious traditions continued to decline in North America, black people accepted Christianity in large numbers for the first time. Eventually, this religious zeal turned to revolution and sentiments of self-governance. And, spiritual equality quickly transformed into political equality, leading colonists to grow more and more discontent towards the way Parliament was treating them with taxes, restrictions, and coercion. Soon, the colonists developed popular self-righteousness, when their self-assertion turned against the tyrannical ways of George III. That the religious spirit of the colonists was a necessary component to the drive for independence is confirmed in the sentiments of those who lived during the period of fighting. As British statesman William Knox noted about the American drive for independence, “Every man being thus allowed to be his own Pope, he becomes disposed to wish to become his own King”. The religious revival of the Great Awakening and the political kindling of the Enlightenment melded the colonists in a way that would not have been possible otherwise, giving them the strength, determination, and cause to fight and win the American Revolution.
In the mid to late 1800s and early 1900s, European powers set their interests on one place: Africa. They wanted to exploit Africa’s resources, expand their wealth and power, and colonize the natives. Only, this wasn’t colonialism, like colonialism in the 1600s and 1700s. This was imperialism. Each major European power opined different interpretations and attitudes toward imperialism. There were three main motivations for imperialism: the civilizing mission, economic rationale, and nationalism. Economic rationale was by far the most driving catalyst. The first impetus for imperialism was the “civilizing mission.” Leaders in European countries felt a desire to civilize the African natives. They felt as if they were civilized noblemen, and the Africans were savages. From this they concluded that these “backward peoples” (Document 7) would be “unable to develop the wealth of their land” (Document 7). According to Martial Henri Merlin (Document 7), the civilizing mission was Europe’s right. He argues that Europe should be responsible for the Africans, and Europe wields a duty to help the natives become more like them: sophisticated. Europe thought that they experienced innovation throughout their history, such as the Enlightenment and the First and Second Industrial Revolution, while Africa, separated by Europe due to its continual domination by the Ottoman Empire. This caused Europe to believe that they were more intelligent and more educated than African natives. As stated by Archibald Philip Primrose (Document 5), for the modern world, Europe needed to include Africa in an “imperial race”. Then Europe would thrive in the world in accordance to Herbert Spencer’s idea of “survival of the fittest” (Document 5). A second, and perhaps the most important, motivation for imperialism was the economic justification. Europe saw the land, oil, materials, even the people of Africa as sources of profit. Europe seized the natural resources of Africa as materials to manufacture goods, and coerced the African people into harvesting these resources. Europe also forced Africans into buying their finished products. Africa became a “new market” (Document 6), and Europe became discontent with their home markets. According to Joseph Chamberlain (Document 3), imperials in Africa could help those unemployed in Britain. This is a major connection to the economy in that the increase in raw materials from African colonies arriving in Britain will require more people to work in factories to produce completed products from raw elements. This view of seizing economic advantages was a relatively new idea. Before Europe saw the beneficial standpoint of Africa, not a lot of people supported cruising over there and taking over. People such as Benjamin Disraeli, the British prime minister in 1876, advocated for keeping his country’s focus centered at home. In Document 1, a short, two-sentence quote is all that is needed to show the rapid switch in attitude towards imperialism. Some, within the time frame of these sources, still believed that Africa was not worth the time and effort. Otto von Bismarck, chancellor of Germany, stated that Europe was his Africa (Document 2). Germany was geographically wedged in between France and Russia. If Germany sent troops and efforts to claim territory in Africa, it would leave Germany vulnerable to siege. Bismarck temporarily focused on Germany itself, and not the future German colonies in Africa. The last catalyst for imperialism was nationalism. Nationalism was the belief that the people in a country or continent should be united together by nationality, not religion. At the start of imperialism, African was comprised of tens, hundreds, of numerous villages and small cities, each comprised of natives of different ethnicities. Some European leaders sought to change that. William Clark, a newspaper editor in London, argued that “[although] capitalism in international,” nationalism is what he believed will turn Africa into an ally. Turning Africa into British colonies would benefit the mother country while unifying Africa under one “better” country. Nationalists felt strong loyalty towards their country. They may have even believed that their leader had divine help to conquer all enemies. The people conquered by these nationalist colonists were often called “inferior” or “savages”; that way, leaders could justify taking their land and property. Of the three, economic benefits was the most critical motive. Africa’s unused natural resources were most likely the most redolent. European countries could not resist those resources going to waste. While imperialism may seem similar or almost identical to colonialism, the difference between imperialism and colonialism is that imperialism involved the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory, while colonialism refers to the implanting of settlements on a distant territory.
In the early 1960s conservatives continued to benefit from large-scale social and demographic changes. In the South, the growth of the civil-rights movement, industrial expansion, and the rise of an urban middle class revitalized the Republican party. The policies of the Kennedy Administration also helped the conservative cause. As President, Kennedy courted many eastern business leaders, drawing their support away from liberal Republicans. He also undercut much of the appeal of moderate Republicans: his position on civil rights, for example, was virtually indistinguishable from theirs, concerning people of power on both sides of the political spectrum, one of whom was Barry Goldwater, who was concerned “by the unmistakable tendency of the Republican Party to adopt the same course” (Doc 1). As conservatives began to develop positions on key issues which increasingly appealed to voters, liberal Republicans had trouble distinguishing themselves from Kennedy-style liberals. The disastrous consequences Republicanism had on American society were immediately brought to light after President Jimmy Carter’s administration, highlighting the slight fall of the Republican administration having let the US endure “humiliations, insults, and defeats.” (Doc 5) It seems like the Republican platform is accepting how much it has negatively affected American society, foreshadowing the rise of another branch of ideology that saved the derailed wreck of a federal, political, economic, and social train. At the beginning of the 1960s conservatives were in a better position than at any time since the 1930s to challenge moderate Republicans for control of the party. But large obstacles remained. Not only were conservatives widely viewed as wild-eyed fanatics but they squabbled among themselves, had trouble articulating a positive program of reform, had few grassroots organizations, and lacked the funding to make the movement a serious political force. It was President Ronald Reagan who finally coalesced the conservatives into New Conservatism. For many Americans, the economic, social and political trends of the previous two decades -- ranging from crime and racial polarization in many urban centers, to the economic downturn and inflation of the Carter years -- engendered a mood of disillusionment. It also strengthened a renewed suspicion of government and its ability to deal effectively with the country's deep-rooted social and political problems. Especially seen in the previous Presidents’ ability to cope with mainstream social problems such as unemployment and inflation, both of which are depicted as have strictly increased from JFK’s presidency through to Jimmy Carter’s presidency. New Conservatism also rose to prominence from the buttressing of the discontent of the people. Citizens of varying social statuses, from economists to normal people, have expressed indignation in differing areas of social issues. According to Milton Friedman, past reform programs issued by the federal government have not had much success in fixing society. In addition he attributes all of the positive trends and changes that have occurred recently to “the initiative and drive of individuals cooperating through the free market,” (Doc 2) which represents conservative ideals, who traditionally believe in free markets. Friedman is implying his support for conservative ideals to take hold on society and continue improving the US. Other citizens have expressed disgust at the way everyday lives are affected by a lack of intervention and improvement from the Republican/liberal politicians. Many everyday citizens have become distanced from the government because they suffer from social and economic inequality, receiving “very little from taxes,” (Doc 3) government ignorance, “discrimination against women” (Doc 6), and social chaos, such as theft and robbery. In some respects, the popular culture of the 1980s reflected the era’s political conservatism. For many people, the symbol of the decade was the “yuppie”: a baby boomer with a college education, a well-paying job and expensive taste. Many people derided yuppies for being self-centered and materialistic, and surveys of young urban professionals across the country showed that they were, indeed, more concerned with making money and buying consumer goods than their parents and grandparents had been. According to some prominent figures that broadcasted to the general public through television and mass media, the young generation were not thought very highly of. Essentially, many viewed the baby boom generation as non citizen like, selfish, and educated in all of the negative aspects of culture. However, to address these people who “have learned a loss of respect for human life,” (Doc 4) New Conservatism wielded consumerism and materialism to aid the economy to grow by advertising and directing most information towards this relatively large, consumeristic generation. For instance, blockbusters, movies, TV shows, fashion, etc. were products integrated into popular culture to revert the economy based on the greed and gluttony of the consumerism of the largest generation at the time.
In order to address the needs of the US economic system, both Progressives and the New Deal attempted to reform social and political systems, although they often differed in their strategies and beliefs. While both conservatives and the New Deal both attempted to achieve their economic goals through federal legislature, conservatives took a business-oriented approach in the belief that proliferation of business would lead to a better economy. Their Business Doctrine focused on income tax reductions, increases in tariff rates, and creating a national budget. On the other hand, the New Deal sought to address the growing economic disparity with relief for the unemployed, recovery for businesses, and reform of economic institutions such as banks. From the years 1933 to 1936, President Franklin D. Roosevelt passed a group of domestic programs. The programs were designed to stimulate the economy and were a direct response to devastating economic effects of The Great Depression. The programs were based on three important ideas: relief, recovery, and reform. The Progressive Movement (before the New Deal) was a time from late 19th century to early 20th century in which political, cultural, and economic arenas were rapidly changing due to the Industrial Revolution. The New Deal differs from the Progressive Movement in that it was a time of regrouping and getting the people back on its feet, and the Progressive Movement was a time of moving ahead with great ideas and innovations. The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States that spanned from the 1890s to the 1920s. The main objectives of the Progressive movement were eliminating problems caused by industrialization, urbanization, immigration, and corruption in government. The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office a further means of direct democracy would be established. They also sought regulation of monopolies (Trust Busting) and corporations through antitrust laws. These antitrust laws were seen as a way to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitors. Many progressives supported prohibition of alcoholic beverages, ostensibly to destroy the political power of local bosses based in saloons, but others out of a religious motivation. At the same time, women's suffrage was promoted to bring a "purer" female vote into the arena. The New Deal was a series of federal programs, public work projects, financial reforms and regulations enacted in the United States during the 1930s in response to the Great Depression. Some of these federal programs included the Civilian Conservation Corps, the Civil Works Administration, the Farm Security Administration, the National Industrial Recovery Act of 1933 and the Social Security Administration. These programs included support for farmers, the unemployed, youth and the elderly as well as new constraints and safeguards on the banking industry and changes to the monetary system. Most programs were enacted between 1933–1938, though some were later. They included both laws passed by Congress as well as presidential executive orders, most during the first term of the presidency of Franklin D. Roosevelt. The predominant difference between the Progressive Era and the New Deal is their reasons for being creating or implemented. The Progressive Era and reform movements advocated for by the Progressives were primarily in response to political and social unrest caused by the division of social classes and political machinations and bosses. The New Deal was brought to the country’s interest because of its ramifications to fix the devastating effects of the Great Depression. Also, the perspective of the two movements were different. That being said, the New Deal was never a movement; it was more of a government intervention that gained much support by those who were in the dust because of the Great Depression. The New Deal was created by the federal government and launched by President Franklin D Roosevelt. Americans, battered by 25 percent unemployment, Dust Bowl droughts, and four waves of bank failures, welcomed the government's rescue. FDR's New Deal introduced Keynesian economic theory. It said government spending could end the depression by stimulating consumer demand. The New Deal was a far cry from the President Hoover's "...hear-nothing, see-nothing, do-nothing Government," derided by FDR in his 1936 Campaign speech. In FDR's first 100 days, he pushed Congress to pass 16 new agencies and laws. Together, they created "capitalism with safety nets and subsidies," according to historian Lawrence Davidson. Many of these programs, such as Social Security, the Securities and Exchange Commission, and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation are still safeguarding your finances today. Progressives, on the other hand, were more focused on smaller, but no less appalling aspects of society, such as women’s rights, child labor, prohibition, and living and working conditions. Interestingly, Progressives were more focused on women and children, outcrying for laws and reforms such as the Keating Owen Act (1916) while the New Deal was more focused on providing job opportunities almost solely to men, such as how the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) was focused on helping the men who fought in WWI integrate back into society. Of course, the two movements were from different time periods, one after the other. And different time periods means different things are going on. The Progressives came from an era where people and the government didn’t need to focus on abroad things, so domestic issues were the more important focuses. While for the New Deal, the country was suffering from the Great Depression and lots of tensions in Europe and Asia, so the federal government had to implement large-scale reforms and projects to get the country back on track.
The Progressive Era was a period of widespread social activism and political reform across the United States, from the 1890s to 1920s. The main objective of the Progressive movement was eliminating corruption in government. The movement primarily targeted political machines and their bosses. By taking down these corrupt representatives in office, a further means of direct democracy would be established. They also sought regulation of monopolies (“trust-busting”) and corporations through antitrust laws. These antitrust laws were seen as a way to promote equal competition for the advantage of legitimate competitors. The main statutes were the Sherman Act of 1890, the Clayton Act of 1914, and the Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914. But just how progressive was the Progressive Era? In terms of social, political, and economic reforms and changes, the Progressive Era was quite progressive. For example, the Settlement House movement was a reformist social movement that began in the 1880s and peaked around the 1920s in England and the United States. Its objective was to get the rich and poor in society to live more closely together in an interdependent community. It established “settlement houses” in poor urban areas, where volunteer middle-class “settlement workers” would live in hopes of sharing knowledge and culture with, and alleviating the poverty, of their low-income neighbors. By 1913, there were 413 settlements in 32 states. This movement gained much popularity, especially among middle-class women, including prominent social reformer Jane Addams. These were quite successful, providing lower and middle-class workers with opportunities to succeed in an urban community where industrialization was slowly exerting control over the economy and society. Progressives sought to enable the citizenry to rule more directly and circumvent political bosses. They also instituted the recall, referendum, and initiative. Reformers also helped pave the way to direct election of senators, which was legalized through the 17th Amendment. Trust-busting was a key goal in the Progressive Movement. Public officials during the Progressive Era put passing and enforcing strong antitrust policies high on their agenda. President Theodore Roosevelt sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, and William Howard Taft sued 75. Progressives also enacted laws that regulated businesses to protect workers. Child-labor laws were designed to prevent the overworking of children in the newly emerging industries. The goal of these laws was to give working-class children the opportunity to go to school and to mature more naturally, thereby liberating the potential and encouraging the advancement of humanity. Prohibition was promoted by the “dry” crusaders, a movement led by rural Protestants and social Progressives in the Democratic and Republican parties, and was coordinated by the Anti-Saloon League and the Woman’s Christian Temperance Union. Prohibition was instituted with the ratification of the Eighteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution on January 16, 1919. It prohibited the, “manufacture, sale, or transportation of intoxicating liquors within, the importation thereof into, or the exportation thereof from the United States.” Lastly, the Progressives campaigned for women’s rights. The movement for women’s suffrage gained new vitality during the Progressive Era. The reform campaigns of the Progressive Era strengthened the suffrage movement. Beginning around 1900, this broad movement began at the grassroots level with such goals as combating corruption in government, eliminating child labor, and protecting workers and consumers. Many of its participants saw women’s suffrage as yet another Progressive goal, and they believed that the addition of women to the electorate would help their movement achieve its other goals. In 1912, the Progressive Party, formed by Theodore Roosevelt, endorsed women’s suffrage. The burgeoning Socialist movement also aided the drive for women’s suffrage in some areas. All in all, the Progressive Movement was not only progressive, but revolutionary. It brought to light the issues that nagged American citizens for a long period of time, and campaigned vigorously for change and repeal towards certain injustices in American society in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.
Sectionalism refers to the different economies, social structure, customs, and political values of the North and the South. Sectionalism increased steadily between 1800 and 1860 as the North industrialized, urbanized, and built prosperous farms, while the deep South concentrated on plantation agriculture based on slave labor together with subsistence farming for the poor white families. During the 1850s, sectionalism grew wider as the country's leaders debated whether to allow slavery to expand into the western territories and as criticism of slavery intensified in some free states. The Compromise of 1850 had temporarily settled some of the sectional divisions, but it did not solve the problems that resulted from the existence of slavery in part of the nation. Critics of slavery became more numerous in the free states, and during the 1850s a once-small group of committed abolitionists attracted new followers. At the same time many defenders of slavery adopted a radical pro-slavery set of beliefs that made compromise between the extreme opponents of slavery and its most extreme defenders ever more difficult. Slavery’s western expansion created problems for the United States from the very start. Battles emerged over the westward expansion of slavery and over the role of the federal government in protecting the interests of slaveholders. Northern workers felt that slavery suppressed wages and stole land that could have been used by poor white Americans to achieve economic independence. Southerners feared that without slavery’s expansion, the abolitionist faction would come to dominate national politics and an increasingly dense population of slaves would lead to bloody insurrection and race war. Constant resistance from enslaved men and women required a strong pro-slavery government to maintain order. As the North gradually abolished human bondage, enslaved men and women headed North on an underground railroad of hideaways and safe houses. Northerners and Southerners came to disagree sharply on the role of the federal government in capturing and returning these freedom seekers. While Northerners appealed to their states’ rights to refuse capturing runaway slaves, Southerners demanded a national commitment to slavery. Enslaved laborers meanwhile remained vitally important to the nation’s economy, fueling not only the southern plantation economy but also providing raw materials for the industrial North. Differences over the fate of slavery remained at the heart of American politics, especially as the United States expanded. After decades of conflict, Americans north and south began to fear that the opposite section of the country had seized control of the government. By November 1860, an opponent of slavery’s expansion arose from within the Republican Party. During the secession crisis that followed, fears, nearly a century in the making, at last devolved into bloody war. The effects of the sectional crisis were many people in the North and the South began to polarize along similar fault lines, and various disparate political organizations began to coalesce into distinct camps. The Republicans became the party of the North, promoting industry and business while also attracting anti-slavery factions. By the election of 1860, these political camps were firmly aligned with Northern and Southern interests, with Southern states whipping up public support for state conventions to vote on secession if Abraham Lincoln and the Republicans won the presidency. The antebellum era of short-term compromise and evasion between the political camps was heading toward an end.
When Christopher Columbus discovered North America, the Spanish and the English were hot on his heels after they perused his publications about his discoveries. They found vast amounts of land, natural resources, and indigenous peoples. Before long, the Spanish and English established their respective colonies and began to harvest resources from the land and slaves from the natives. The Spanish seized control in Central and South America, the Caribbean Islands, most of modern-day Mexico, and Florida. The English settlers, more commonly known as the Puritans and the Pilgrims, landed in the Atlantic Coast and established the Massachusetts Bay Colony, Jamestown, Virginia, and a number of other colonies. Major similarities between the two different colonies include indentured servitude and economic exploitation. Major differences include period of settlement, religious purposes, and relations with the American Indians. When the Spaniards and the English arrived in the Americas, they found many Native Americans who were uneducated, peaceful, and most importantly, fit for labor. This led to the resemblance between Spanish and English colonies: both wanted to capitalize on free labor by enslaving the Native Americans. Both colonies wanted to expand their empire’s power and wealth and become more powerful by cultivating the resources found in the Americas. One important difference between the colonies was settlement. The Spanish were sent to simply trade with the American Indians, supply their mother country with assets they did not have, and return to Spain. The Puritans and the Pilgrims, however, were escaping religious persecution from those in England. Due to this, the English came to the Americas with the intention of permanent settlement and residence. Also, the English colonists were mostly middle-class farmers, tradesmen, and indentured servants. It is very likely that more than a few of the original colonists were not doing well socially in England and immigrated to the Americas for a fresh start. This gave them very little incentive to return to their mother country. The Spanish colonists, on the other hand, were mostly conquistadores, soldiers, and missionaries who were there to either subjugate the Native Americans or convert them to Christianity. Another important difference was religion. As mentioned before, the English settlers were primarily Puritans and Pilgrims, who were Protestants, and they faced persecution in England. When they established their colonies, most of the colonies did not have religious toleration, the Puritans in Massachusetts especially. The Quakers in Pennsylvania were slightly more tolerant towards people whose religious views varied from their own. The Spanish colonies were Catholic only. Protestants were persecuted and driven out. Because Spaniards were more concerned with conversion, they eventually integrated indigenous peoples into their culture, albeit not equally. The English were more concerned with excluding indigenous peoples from colonial society so they were more likely to dislocate them from their lands.
Totalitarianism is a system of government that is centralized and dictatorial and requires complete subservience to the state. Some countries, such as Italy, Germany, and the USSR moved toward a system of totalitarianism. Totalitarian governments use terror, repression of free speech, and propaganda to control society. Totalitarianism had a major rise in Germany, due to quite a few causes after Germany lost WWI. The humiliating treatment of Germany by the Treaty of Versailles created a sense of hatred and revenge amongst the Germans. The treaty had mutilated Germany physically through war damage, humiliated it emotionally, suffocated it economically through the reparations payments, and encircled the country territorially. This had greatly offended the popular sentiments in Germany. Hitler fully exploited these sentiments to establish his dictatorship in Germany. In 1933 he was elected to power. He told the people he would put food on their table and money in their pockets. Propaganda within Nazi Germany was highly effective. The Nazis realized the importance of the radio and newspapers as a means to communicate with the masses. they were also highly aware of the force that these medias had and the level of influence that they had over the population. Carefully planned radio broadcasts, rallies and films were used to convince the public that Hitler and the Nazi Party had the overwhelming support of the masses. The news was engineered to show successes brought about by the parties policies and techniques such as subliminal messaging were used to brainwash the masses into a state of belief and hysteria. In effect all news, rumor and opinion within the state was produced or influenced by the government, a classic sign of a totalitarian leader exerting his control. The effect of totalitarianism is basically the opposite of a democracy: the people have no say whatsoever in political affairs. Political groups or parties effect laws that give control of the government and military to a power elite that diverts government revenues to their constituents while suppressing the general public’s right to collective bargaining, assembly, and their right to address the government. The press is usually an arm of the government or a political party and adept at distorting the views and position of the dissent. The elite in control would have no accountability, therefore there would be a gross level of injustice in every paradigm of society. Dictatorship and totalitarianism are often associated, but they are actually two separate phenomena. Dictatorship is a form of government in which the ruler has the power to govern without consent of those being governed. Dictatorship can also be defined simply as “a system that does not adhere to democracy,” where democracy is defined as a form of government where those who govern are selected through contested elections. A dictator's power can originate in his or her family, political position, or military authority.
