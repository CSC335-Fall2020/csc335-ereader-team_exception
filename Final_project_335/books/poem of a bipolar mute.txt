Kind of 
I hate poetry 
Hey Calhoun I hate poetry! 
There, done. I can’t speak. 
You’re weird. 
It doesn’t need to rhyme you doorknob. 
I also hate art. 
Any art. 
The only arts I can appreciate are music and the art of math. 
Garbage, Shakespeare is a no talent hack 
Movies are cool 
That’s not art that’s a program 
Can you consider programming art of the computer? 
I’m not. I’m pretending to be a bipolar mute. 
I despise literature. 
That’s a contradiction in terms. 
Like jumbo shrimp. 
Calculus 
I don’t have a least favorite 
No I don’t 
Rolle’s Theorem is a worthless piece of sh*t 
Depends 
Fudge you Ethan 
Do I like science? 
I like Physics. I’m ok with Chemistry. I couldn’t give an f about biology. I don’t care what goes on inside me. At least some areas of Physics use calculus. Biology doesn’t. I call bs. 
This is very entertaining. 
I’ll acquiesce that. 
Yes it is. 
I know what it means. On account of the fact that I came across it in a book and looked it up. 
Sci-fi is not literature. 
You worthless, Mia. 
Actually, “acquiesce” wasn’t even in a sci-fi book. It was just a fiction novel. No it’s not. 
All the garbage we read in AP Literature is literature. 
My favorite book? Anything by Dan Brown 
Fiction author. You should read his works. Sometimes 
My least favorite. I don’t have a least favorite book. 
Or, a better way to say that is that I can’t think of a book I despise. 
What’s a Barbie? 
Are they edible? 
Darn it. 
Wait… 
I can burn them? 
YAAAAAAAAAASSSS 
Can I burn you? 
Hey! Does anyone have a match? 
I could use one! 
To set you on fire. 
I would assume if someone has a match they would have the box that comes with matches 
OK then! Anyone have kerosene?? 
As many as how long this conversation continues. 
Besides, I’m also practicing typing. 
Dan Brown has written: 
Inferno, Deception Point, Digital Fortress, The Da Vinci Code, Angel and Demons 
The Count of Monte Cristo I have read. 
It’s been so long ago that I don’t remember. 
6th. My dad wanted me to read it. 
This was Mia’s idea! Take the blame, squib. 
Roflmao 
Yeah, that’s Lili’s catchphrase. 
Squib is from Harry Potter. 
I call bs! 
BS!! 
Stop hitting me. 
What is that? 
Nein. 
Nope! 
Mia, pay attention! 
Slacker 
These are the mindless ramblings of a bipolar mute. 
Yeet! 
My brain is an enigma. 
And so am I. 
There’s more than just maths in my brain you dingus 
I don’t have one. 
If I had to choose probably Carlsen 
Wait! 
No my favorite is Sergey Kasparov 
Because he wrote the book on the Philidor 
He’s a funny looking dude 
He has really big eyes 
And a really easygoing smile 
Stop laughing Lili 
Squib 
Is this a one-way interview? 
Thank you Captain Obvious of course I have music playing. 
I don’t get it. 
Ah I see 
Ooh that’s a hard one 
Probably cheese 
Any cheese besides feta, gorgonzola, blue cheese, or stinky cheese 
You can fudge off Ethan 
I don’t give a fudge 
Nope it’s made of chocolate 
I despise chocolate 
Depends 
Vanilla ice cream sure 
You don’t want to know 
UChicago, MIT, Stanford, Harvard, Princeton, Cornell, Duke, John Hopkins, Carnegie Mellon, Harvey Mudd, ASU Barrett’s is my safety school 
I HATE DOCTORS 
I’m halfway through my application for ASU it was interrupted because I had to leave for this tournament 
Probably, all except Cornell, Duke, John Hopkins, and Carnegie Mellon 
B/c they’re all ED 
Early decision 
Can you read lili 
I can’t 
We have one more round you doorknob 
Any other interrogating questions? 
Computer science/engineering or artificial intelligence 
That’s a crime against me 
I can’t even spell engineering 
Applied mathematics 
It’s not going to not work out 
I don’t believe in just in case FYI 
Hello darkness my old friend, I’ve come to talk with you again. Because a vision softly creeping, left its seeds while I was sleeping. 
It’s a song lyric you idiot 
You’re not sorry 
I did once 
In China 
It was alright 
It wasn’t bad 
Noo 
You said sorry, but you’re not sorry 
The song is the “Sound of Silence” by Disturbed 
Oh that’s too easy 
Justin Bieber 
Adele 
Or T Swift 
That’s his name 
Simon Garfunkel originally wrote the song but he is trash at singing 
Disturbed is better 
No talent hack 
Garbage 
Tu trozo de mierda!! 
Spanish 
We can do this after the round I suppose if we finish quickly 
5 pages 
Yes it is. This can be whatever it wants to be. 
Ehm… 
In BASIS? 
I feel like I probably shouldn’t answer that because it would be really biased. 
Calhoun 
Duh 
I try not to hate people… 
That I’ve had? Or in general? 
At BASIS? 
Yeet! 
Yeah, but my favorite teacher is Calhoun 
If you’re not limiting my options to BASIS then answering this is easy 
I googled this once 
I don’t remember 
There’s no wifi 
Wireless something 
Do you want me to answer the least favorite teacher question? 
Don’t have one. 
I am exceptionally good at skipping meals and generally avoid spending money on myself, especially when it concerns food 
Favorite song? That’s easy. 
Hellcat by Desmeon 
I could let you listen to it 
Okip 
Stupid flies 
Not sure 
Wait no 
It’s not blue 
Either cerulean or silver 
Snake 
I don’t have a least favorite author/writer 
My least favorite writer is myself 
Whose books would I never read? 
Idk next question 
Fifth grade was in China for me 
But I had this b**** of a teacher who sent me to the principal’s office for having a pair of scissors on my desk 
The teachers in China generally suck, although there are exceptions. My homeroom teacher for 4-6th grade was really good 
This is so much slower than talking 
But there’s no imminent danger of saliva ejection 
Probably not because I can think of some very personal questions 
That you may ask 
Like who do you have a crush on? 
I’m not telling you that 
What person? 
I can neither confirm nor deny details of any operation without the Secretary’s approval 
Because where else would I put them? 
Indoors? 
Because it’s hard to see? 
DUH DUH DUH 
I do do that, but sometimes there’s something else on my head, like my tennis hat 
I’ve worn this for a while 
That’s a reference to my favorite movie series 
Mission Impossible 
Well the reference above is from the fifth movie, but yes, there is a sixth that came out recently. I went to go see it it was amazing. 
Duh tom cruise is the lead actor 
WHAT???? 
HOW DARE YOU!!!! 
BLASPHEMY!!!! 
JUDGE!!!! 
Idk 
I love roasting people 
Damn it 
Tennis 
Lili could answer that question for me 
1 
DON’T CALL HIM LITTLE 
What grade are you in? 
Darn it I thought he was older 
He’s in eighth 
Yes 
I looked like a first grader before high school 
I was short af 
Oh awards time! 
Yes and no 
Leaning towards not really 
There is no point that’s why they’re memes 
That is an excellent question that I unfortunately cannot answer 
I’m hungry 
Scratch that 
My stomach hurts 
I’m being interrogated 
Oh. It’s a tie between the spitting cobra and the mantis shrimp 
Nah my favorite animal is Jaden 
8 pages! 
Close to nine 
Um… - Mia 
Ummmmm… - Mia 
The horses duh 
They’re horses. They can’t roundhouse kick me in the face 
I’d probably just get on one. 
I have weapons 
Chuck Norris is the size of a normal human being 
How big can a horse that size be? 
Awww, look it’s a bunch of ponies! 
Totmtyl 
Top of the morning to ya ladies 
My name is jacksepticeye 
And welcome back to HAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAPY WHEEEEEEEEEEEEEEELS!!!! 
It’s a video game that jacksepticeye made 100 videos on 
I’m not moving until awards

Blech pencil 
I hate pencils 
No I can do it with multiple

i don't know! i haven't talked to him
because he's all the way across the country?
he's busy
i could challenge him on chess.com
i miss cyrus and adam and lucas crane
i wonder if you guys will miss me when i'm gone
awwwwww
you should get better at typing
i took a typing class in fourth grade
most of my grade can't type very quickly
a motley few can
like me patrick idk who else
cue more jeopardy music
that i beat or that i lost to?
i've played a lot of high rated people
rick sun, dave mohan, josh lynch, prateek pinisetti, darian nguyen, richard qi
i've played rick sun twice, drawn and lost
i've played dave mohan four times, twice in blitz i won both, i beat him once in slow chess at uscf state in april 2018
i lost to him in aia state last year
prateek is basis chandler's board one
i beat him at aia state last year my best game ever
i've played darian once and lost
i've played richard qi once and won
i think all of them besides rick and richard are seniors
dave mohan is definitely a senior
he's my age
no 17
yeet
he does! ethan noah and i were discussing this last night in the car! it all depends on which class he likes
he likes ethan's grade in general
i'm pretty sure he didn't like my grade or cyrus's
i don't know about yours or the sophomores
actually
i'm in his 2nd hour precalc b grading for him
plueger is hilarious
especially when he gets really pissed off
like one time he was teaching about antilogarithms
and he got so mad and everyone started laughing
"plug it into your damn calculator"
of course he does and it's hilarious
well because you guys are younger
more innocent
you're in precalc a right
calvin and i rarely grade your class
i think we do it every monday?
because for some reason plueger doesn't do any grading over the weekends
om nom nom nom nom nom nom
no he just has a really good poker face
so do i
i love poker
no not really
i'm doing one right now
can you tell if i'm bluffing?
exactly
muahahahaha
not very long since march altho i have been playing it very avidly
that's why i'm better than some other seniors that have been playing it since last year
lili sucks
of course
i have like 300 more trophies
don't worry it's mutual
she hits me
i prefer psychological torment over physical violence
but lili is all physical
she'll like punch me in the ribs
yeah but it's fine she's a girl so it doesn't hurt
i also do enjoy roasting people
because we're all sexist
where do you think i got the nickname "roastmaster"?
i started my roasting career when i was a sophomore
i actually got a book from patrick for my 17th birthday by the one and only roast general jeffrey ross
"i only roast the ones i love: how to bust balls without burning bridges"
i never finished the book
mostly because he's old and i don't understand what he's trying to say or who he's roasting
writ? it's 'when was the book written' you fool
idk
2010s?
i never checked
yeah but the celebrities he was roasting back then are completely unfamiliar to me
they're so obscure i can't even remember their names
because it's fun!
also because of bayer
and max dittberner
bayer started to insult the chess team
and i had to defend the team and insult the basketball team back
and it all kind of snowballed
well as an example last year in apush jonas turned in his hw packet early and he said bayer i hope you don't lose this
bayer said i never lose anything
i replied other than half of the basketball games this season
nope
actually
just this past week bayer got roasted
i didn't say it out loud tho
he said the basketball season is almost over and his life is over
someone said what do you mean
he said my life is dedicated to basketball
i whipsered to benji aren't people supposed to dedicate their lives to something they're good at?
lili had the greatest roast of bayer
hold on let me try to remember
ok so bayer was yelling at her apush class
someone said bayer do you get paid to yell at us?
bayer said no i get paid to teach you
lili said that's why you get paid so little
not out loud
to sadie who told rachel who then told me and i leapt out of my chair and started shouting OOOOOHHHHH
not in the class of course a few days later
yes
yeet
oh come on there's too many
let me look
oh ok i can do top five
there's one really good one by ethan's younger brother but i can't tell it to any female audience
this one is by my namesake churchill
i may be drunk miss but in the morning i will be sober and you will still be ugly
bc you can't tell if a woman is good looking when you're drunk
this one is by me
i don't need to checkmate you. i'll just make six queens
do you know what alliteration is?
ok here's a great quote then
we will be wary of winston when we wage war
no pants, no problem! that's my motto!
i was cheesing my bagel!
lili is like a cat and a three-year-old. they naturally assume everything is theirs
ok, at this point it's clear this horse is on a sugar high - ethan bamberg
matthew stop conquering the table!
i'm gonna calvin my way out of this
well i can't count
1 3 r 6 to 3.5 -1 pi pigs 50 i don't see a five on there
i'm about to hit seven pages in my quotebook yay
keep it FOREVER
i will open it when i'm in college and remember high school years
what did you say?
exactly
nostalgia i why i'm doing it
